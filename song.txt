I was on fire for you,
Where did you go?
I could've died for you,
How could you not know?
I was alive with you,
But you brought in the cold.
Was I being lied to?
Wish I never met you,
Started to regret you.

My heart just dropped,
Thinking' about you.
The world just stops,
When I'm without you.

I was on fire for you.
Fire on fire, fire on fire...
I was on fire for you.
Fire on fire, fire on fire...

Вторая половина песни 

I was on fire for you,
You breaking me down.
Don't know what should I do,
When you come around.
I'm leaving without you, love.
I have no choice.
I know I'm being lied to,
I just need some time to
Stop thinking about you

My heart just dropped,
Thinking' about you.
The world just stops,
When I'm without you.
My heart just dropped,
Thinking' about you.
The world just stops,
When I'm without you.

I was on fire for you.
Fire on fire, fire on fire...
I was on fire for you.
Fire on fire, fire on fire...
I was on fire for you.
Fire on fire, fire on fire...
I was on fire for you.
Fire on fire, fire on fire...
I was on fire for you.
Fire on fire, fire on fire...
