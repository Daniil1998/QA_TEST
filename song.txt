I was on fire for you,
Where did you go?
I could've died for you,
How could you not know?
I was alive with you,
But you brought in the cold.
Was I being lied to?
Wish I never met you,
Started to regret you.

My heart just dropped,
Thinking' about you.
The world just stops,
When I'm without you.

I was on fire for you.
Fire on fire, fire on fire...
I was on fire for you.
Fire on fire, fire on fire...
